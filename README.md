# CS-0445-Assignment-2

This is the second assignment from my Data Structures class. The assignment was to create a class called MyStringBuilder, that mimiced the
functionality of the standard Java StringBuilder class. The catch is that MyStringBuilder had to be implemented with a LinkedList as the
underlying data structure as opposed to the ArrayList of the StringBuilder class.
